_First of all, I don't know how to name that fucking script._

Hi my name is Piter Van Rujpen or Respow or TheGamerRespow, take the one that you prefer.

About a week ago I made a simple script to get the coordinates of a certain position and I know what you'll tell me : "Bruhhh... Lamba Menu already does it". But does the Lamba Menu gives you the heading and the radius of a marker, a marker that you can anywhere you want to get a precise position ? I don't think so.

**How to use it**

- Press "B" and then a blue marker will spawn right on you, the arrow will indicate the heading. 
- Press any arrow to move arround the marker. 
- Press "PAGE UP" and "PAGE DOWN" to change to height of the marker.
- Press "'NUMPAD 4" and "NUMPAD 6" to rotate/change the heading of the marker.
- Press "NUMPAD +"  and "NUMPAD -" to change the radius of the marker.
- Press "'ENTER" to save the position in the _positions.txt_ file (this one is located in the server folder, and it will be always cleared when you restart the server).

- You can also press "BACKSPACE" to cancel the process.

**How to install it**

- Use your brain.
